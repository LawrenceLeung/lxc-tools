lxc-debian
==========

`lxc-debian' is a script to create and destroy debian based linux containers.
This particular version is based on the one that ships with the lxc package in
debian unstable (/usr/share/doc/lxc/examples/lxc-debian.gz), but with a few
modifications to make it a little easier to use.

To create a container, run

    lxc-debian create

To remove one, run

    lxc-debian destroy

If you want to script some operations for when a container is created, I have
added some hooks:

    /etc/lxc-debian/host-pre-create

        Shell script that runs on the host before the container is created. It
        is sourced by lxc-debian, so has access to variables like $NAME, which
        is the name of the container being created.

    /etc/lxc-debian/host-post-create

        Shell script that runs on the host after the container is created. It
        is sourced by lxc-debian, so has access to variables like $NAME, which
        is the name of the container being created.

    /etc/lxc-debian/guest-post-create

        Script that runs in the container after creation. It's run by chrooting
        in, so naturally it doesn't have access to variables, though you can
        get at that information through other ways (e.g. /etc/hostname).

init
====

`init' is an init.d script you can install as /etc/init.d/lxc, that allows you
to automatically start up and shut down containers on system start up/shut
down. To specify the containers to start and stop, put this into
/etc/default/lxc:

CONTAINERS="name1 name2 name3"
